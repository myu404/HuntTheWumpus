Welcome to "Hunt the Wumpus".
The wumpus lives in a dungeon of 20 caves.Each cave has 3 tunnels to other caves.
(Look at a dodecahedron to see how this works.If you print "don't know what a dodecahedron is, ask someone.)

Hazards:
        Bottomless pits - Two caves have bottomless pits in them.If you go there, you fall into the pit(& lose)!
        Super bats - Two caves have super bats.If you go there, a bat grabs you and takes you to some other room at random(which may be troublesome).
Wumpus:
        The wumpus is not bothered by hazards. (He has sucker feet and is too big for a
bat to lift.) Usually he is asleep.Two things wake him up : your shooting an
arrow, or your entering his room.If the wumpus wakes, he moves(75 % of the time)
one room or stays still(25 % of the time). After that, if he is where you are, he eats you upand you lose!

Each turn you may move or shoot a crooked arrow.
Moving : You can move one cave(through one tunnel).
Arrows : You have 5 arrows.You lose when you run out.Each arrow can go from 1 to 5 caves.You aim by telling the caves to which you want the arrow to go.
If the arrow can't go that way (if no tunnel) it moves at random to a neighboring cave.
        If the arrow hits the wumpus, you win.
        If the arrow hits you, you lose.
Warnings :
        When you are one room away from a wumpus or hazard, the computer says:
        Wumpus: "I smell a wumpus!"
        Bat : "Bats nearby!"
        Pit : "I feel a draft!"
